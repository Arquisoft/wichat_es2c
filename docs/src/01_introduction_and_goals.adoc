=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

To achieve this enhanced application experience, its main functionalities are:

* **User Registration and Participation History:** Each user will have a personal account where their game data will be stored, allowing them to view their progress at any time.
* **Question and Answer System based on Wikidata:** The various questions, accompanying images, and answer options will be generated based on information gathered from Wikidata.
* **Chatbot and Hint System:** The user will have the optional functionality of a chatbot that, upon request, will provide a series of hints based on information retrieved from Wikidata, guiding them towards the correct answer without revealing it outright.
* **User Interaction with the Application:** The user will interact with the application through a highly intuitive and user-friendly web front-end.


=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Description 
| **Usability** | The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly to ensure the user can navigate the application optimally.  
| **Performance** | The system should deliver responses within an acceptable time frame to ensure fast and efficient game sessions.
| **Accuracy** | The hint generation mechanism should minimize errors and hallucinations to maximize the chatbot’s functionality.
| **Scalability** | The architecture should allow easy updates and feature expansions, making it adaptable for future improvements.
| **Security** | Because user well-being and comfort are of paramount importance, user data and interactions must be properly managed and protected.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
