== Architecture Constraints


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technical Constraints

[options="header", cols="1,1"]
|====
| Constraint | Explanation

| Deployed Web application | The application must be deployed on a server and accessible from a browser. In this case, we will use Docker to deploy it.

| Wikidata | The application will use Wikidata as it will serve as the source of the information displayed in a match's questions.

| LLM | The user will be able to obtain hints via a LLM Chatbot. 

| Documented API | Alongside with the application, a public API will be provided, with its extensive documentation, which will provide access to users information.

| Data management | In order to store and manage the information regarding users and matches, it will be kept in a MongoDB database.

| Tests | The application must pass a series of tests in order to ensure its functionality; failure of any test will block deployment.

| GitHub | We will use GitHub for version control and collaboration on the project.

| Documentation | The documentation of the entire project will be done following the Arc42 template for better clarity in its details and explanations.

=== Organizational Constraints

[options="header", cols="1,1"]
|====
| Constraint | Explanation

| Team of 4 people | The work will be distributed among the 4 members of the group.

| Reports | Every week during the class practice time, we must write minutes documenting what we have done and the next steps to follow.

| Issues | The work assigned to each member will be reflected as issues in GitHub, so that everything is recorded and everyone knows what they have to do.

| Pull requests | In order to improve the workflow and our code consistency, every time a member is about to integrate their work into the main one, another member will review its changes via a Pull Request, requesting changes if seen as necesary.

| Mid-term evaluations | Every 3 weeks the project will be checked, and corrections that need to be made for the upcoming days will be noted.

|====

=== Conventions
|===
| Constraint | Explanation
| Arc42 | The team will follow the Arc42 template in order to structure the project documentation in a consistent and efficient way.
| Use of English | English will be used throughout the project, including documentation, coding, and the GitHub repository, as it is the most widely accepted and understood language in the software development community.
| Good coding practices | The team will adhere to clean code principles such as meaningful naming, modularity, simplicity, and comprehensive documentation. 
| Branchs usage | The team will adopt a branching strategy, keeping every issue in its own branch until it is brought to master via a Pull Request.
