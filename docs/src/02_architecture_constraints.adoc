== Architecture Constraints


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technical Constraints

[options="header", cols="1,1"]
|====
| Restriction | Explanation

| Wikidata API | We will use Wikidata as the database for the places where the player can be found.

| Deploy the application | The application must be deployed on a server and accessible from a browser. In this case, we will use Docker to deploy it.

| GitHub | We will use GitHub for version control and collaboration on the project.

| Tests | The application must pass these tests to ensure its functionality; failure of any test will block deployment.

| Documentation | The documentation of the entire project will be done following the Arc42 template for better clarity in its details and explanations.

=== Organizational Constraints

| Restriction | Explanation

| Team of 4 people | The work will be distributed among the 4 members of the group.

| Reports | Every week during the class practice time, we must write minutes documenting what we have done and the next steps to follow.

| Issues | The work assigned to each member will be reflected as issues in GitHub, so that everything is recorded and everyone knows what they have to do.

| Mid-term evaluations | Every 3 weeks the project will be checked, and corrections that need to be made for the upcoming days will be noted.
