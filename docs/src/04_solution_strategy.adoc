== Solution Strategy

=== Technological decisions
* *JavaScript*: Primary programming language for both frontend and backend development in our project. Fit for full-stack development using a single language, reducing context switching.
* *React*: JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces. It allows developers to create interactive web applications by breaking down the UI into reusable components. React uses a declarative approach to efficiently update and render components, resulting in faster and more maintainable code. It's widely adopted in the industry due to its simplicity, performance, and robustness.
* *Node.js*: JavaScript runtime that enables running JavaScript code outside of web browsers. It's renowned for its event-driven architecture and extensive collection of packages, making it ideal for building scalable server-side applications.
* *Express*: Lightweight framework for Node.js used to build RESTful webs and APIs. Especially useful for the backend development and routing.
* *MongoDB*: popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. It stores data in flexible JSON-like documents and is widely used in modern web development for its simplicity and ability to handle large volumes of data.
* *Wikidata*: Wikidata provides a REST API for retrieving information related to any topic. It helps us to dynamically generate questions for our game using it from any programming language. 
* *LLM Gemini*: LLM model chosen because, in addition to already having an API key for it, it is especially easy to integrate into the application and works more than correctly to meet the needs of the Chatbot.
* *Arc42*: framework (template) used for documenting and communicating software architectures. It provides a template for describing the architecture of a software system, covering aspects such as stakeholders, requirements, architecture decisions, components, interfaces, and quality attributes. arc42 helps teams create consistent and comprehensible architecture documentation, enabling better communication, understanding, and maintenance of software systems throughout their lifecycle.
* *npm*: default package manager for Node.js, providing a command-line interface to install, manage, and publish JavaScript packages. With over a million packages available in its registry, npm simplifies adding functionality to Node.js projects by handling dependencies and providing tools for versioning and publishing packages.
* *Oracle server*: Cloud platform used for deploying our application. The team chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure due to prior experience with its services, which allowed for a smoother and more efficient setup. It provides a reliable environment for hosting our backend, database, and other infrastructure components, supporting scalability and high availability for the game.
* *Docker*: platform that will be used for deploying our services inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker enables developers to package their applications along with all dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
* *GitHub Actions*: built-in automation tool on GitHub that allows us to automate some workflows that are triggered after some specific github branches actions at development. It provides as continuous integration of the game functionality.
* *GitHub*: Version control and project management platform used for managing our game project. GitHub provides features for collaboration, issue tracking, and code review, facilitating efficient development workflows and team communication.

=== Architecture & Design

* *Services based project*: Although not a full microservices architecture, our project is designed in a modular and service-oriented way. Each major functionality is isolated into separate logical units or services that can be developed and maintained independently. This enhances flexibility and maintainability without the complexity of full microservice infrastructure.

* *Containerization with Docker*: We leverage Docker containerization to package each service and its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Docker provides a consistent environment across different stages of the development lifecycle, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability. With Docker, we can easily spin up new instances of services, manage dependencies, and streamline our development and deployment workflows.

* *API Gateway*: We employ an API gateway as a centralized entry point for all client requests to our services. The API gateway serves as a reverse proxy, routing incoming requests to the appropriate service based on predefined rules and policies. It provides a unified interface for clients, abstracting the complexity of the underlying system and improving performance, scalability, and security.


=== Team Organization

For developing this project we are using Github as the control version systems. 
The master branch contains the final version of the product, so that every accepted pull request to master branch will be considered as a new release.

* *Documentation*: it must be always updated for making our work valuable and consistent.
* *Weekly meetings*: Weekly discussions about what has been done and what needs to be done will be key for our team success. 
* *Github*: this control version systems not only allows us to share and collabortively write code, but also provides other resources such as issues and project management (kanban board) tools for organizing the work to be done. Also, wiki section allows us to save all of our minutes from each scheduled meeting.
* *Whatsapp and Discord*: will allow us to be in constant communication for helping each other out whenever needed.

.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.
