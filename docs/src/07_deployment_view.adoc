Motivation::

The deployment diagram provides a clear overview of the system's architecture, illustrating how its components interact and are distributed. 
It helps visualize the structure within Docker, showing the connections between the web server, database, apis and client.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

By deploying the application in Docker, we achieve a consistent and portable environment, reducing compatibility issues across different infrastructures.
To enhance performance, the system leverages cloud services, optimizing resource usage and ensuring availability.
The architecture is designed to handle multiple requests efficiently, maintaining low latency and high responsiveness for users.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
The application is deployed in a Dockerized environment, running on a web server that connects to a cloud-hosted database. 
The client-side interacts with the server via HTTP, while the backend communicates with the wikidata and the selected AI using their respective APIs and manages the database.
This setup ensures scalability, reliability, and efficient resource management.
