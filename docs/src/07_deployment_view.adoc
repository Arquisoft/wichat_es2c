==== Motivation

The deployment diagram provides a clear overview of the system's architecture, illustrating how its components interact and are distributed. It helps visualize the structure within a **Dockerized** environment, showing the connections between the web server, database, external APIs, and client. This diagram makes it easier to understand how services are organized and integrated, providing an accessible overview for development, operations, and management teams.

==== Quality and/or Performance Features

* **Containerized deployment** ensures environment consistency across development, staging, and production environments. All services—such as authservice, userservice, gatewayservice, and gameservice—run inside Docker containers, ensuring parity across all deployment stages and simplifying testing and debugging.

* **Lightweight Docker containers** enable rapid scalability. Each service can be deployed or updated independently, allowing faster delivery cycles and horizontal scaling with minimal manual intervention.

* **Decoupling of backend from external APIs**, such as **Wikidata** and **Empathy**, improves maintainability. Since services like questionservice and llmservice interact with these APIs via well-defined interfaces, they can be updated or replaced without impacting core infrastructure—enhancing resilience and reducing downtime risk.

* **Stateless backend services** (like authservice, llmservice`, gameservice) allow for horizontal scaling. Because user state is stored in **MongoDB**, new instances of services can be added seamlessly to manage load spikes, ensuring reliable performance under high demand.

==== Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure

The application is deployed in a fully **Dockerized environment**, with each service fulfilling a specific role within the system. The infrastructure is composed of:

* **Frontend (WebApp)**: The webapp provides the user interface and communicates with the gatewayservice. It handles user interactions and routes requests to the backend. It's designed to be scalable and decoupled from the logic layer.

* **API Gateway**: The gatewayservice acts as the central point of entry to backend services. It handles request routing, service discovery, and authentication, forwarding requests to userservice, authservice, gameService, userinfoapi, llmservice, or wikidata as needed.

* **Backend Services**:
- authservice: Handles authentication and session management.
- userservice: Manages user registration and profile data.
- userinfoapi: Exposes user data to external consumers.
- llmservice: Connects to the **Empathy API** to generate empathetic hints.
- wikidata: Interfaces with the **Wikidata API** to retrieve factual information.
- gameService: Manages the matches data.

* **Database Layer**: A centralized **MongoDB** instance provides persistent storage for users, sessions, and game data. All services needing storage interact through this database.

* **Client-Server Communication**: Users access the system via a browser (webapp), which communicates with the gatewayservice. From there, requests are routed to internal services depending on their nature (authentication, game interaction, user info, etc.).

* **Backend-API Communication**: The llmservice and wikidata services interact with external APIs, enabling integration with third-party data sources and AI-based services.

* **Scalability and Resilience**: The container-based approach enables scalable deployment of individual services. If load increases, instances of services can be added independently. This architecture supports high availability, rapid recovery, and efficient resource usage.

In summary, the system architecture follows modern cloud-native best practices, ensuring high performance, maintainability, scalability, and fault tolerance. It is well-suited for dynamic environments where flexibility and uptime are critical.
