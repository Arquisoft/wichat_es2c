== Deployment View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

= Motivation

The deployment diagram provides a clear overview of the system's architecture, illustrating how its components interact and are distributed. It helps visualize the structure within a **Dockerized** environment, showing the connections between the web server, database, external APIs, and client. This diagram makes it easier to understand how services are organized and integrated, providing an accessible overview for development, operations, and management teams.

= Quality and/or Performance Features

* **Containerized deployment** ensures environment consistency across dev/staging/prod. This eliminates discrepancies between environments, facilitating testing and debugging by ensuring the system runs the same way in any environment.

* **Lightweight Docker containers** enable rapid scalability and **CI/CD integration**. Containers can be quickly provisioned or removed as needed, making both vertical and horizontal scaling possible with minimal manual configuration.

* **Decoupling of backend from external APIs** improves maintainability. By separating dependencies such as the **Wikidata** API and selected **AI APIs**, the system becomes easier to maintain. Teams can make updates or changes without affecting the rest of the infrastructure, minimizing service disruptions and enhancing system resilience.

* **Stateless backend** facilitates horizontal scaling. This architecture ensures that additional backend instances can be added to handle increased demand. It also optimizes performance under high traffic loads and ensures better load distribution across available resources.

= Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure

The application is deployed in a **Dockerized** environment, consisting of several interconnected services and layers. The main components are:

* **Web Server**: The web server handles client requests and routes them to the appropriate services, such as the database or external APIs. The web server is designed to be **scalable**, allowing additional instances to be added as demand increases.

* **Cloud-hosted Database**: The database is hosted in the cloud, allowing the application to take advantage of the elastic scalability and flexibility offered by cloud services. The database connects to the backend server, providing persistent storage and ensuring data integrity through real-time synchronization.

* **Client-Server Communication**: The client interacts with the system via **HTTP** or **HTTPS**, ensuring secure and efficient communication between the client and the server. Requests are routed through the web server, which processes and directs them to the appropriate services.

* **Backend-API Communication**: The backend communicates with **external APIs** (such as Wikidata and AI) using standard API protocols like **REST** or **GraphQL**. These connections enable access to external data and artificial intelligence services, enriching the systemâ€™s functionality with updated information and external tools.

* **Scalability and Resilience**: This container-based and decoupled service approach ensures that the system is scalable, flexible, and resilient. The use of containers allows for the deployment of multiple instances of any component based on demand, improving the **high availability** of the system.

In summary, this design ensures the system is not only robust and easy to maintain but also adaptable to changes in traffic or market requirements, providing efficient resource management and high reliability.
