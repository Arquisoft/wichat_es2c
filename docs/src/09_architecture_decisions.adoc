[[ADR-003]]
=== ADR 003: Adoption of TypeScript and Tailwind CSS  
*Status: Proposed and Rejected*
*:date: 16/03/2025* 

==== Context

At the beginning of the project, we considered adopting TypeScript as the main programming language. 
The integration with JavaScript would allow us to leverage static typing, improve code readability, and enhance maintainability.
Additionally, we planned to combine TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for styling frontend components, aiming for a consistent and rapid UI development process.

==== Decision

Ultimately, the decision to adopt TypeScript and Tailwind was rejected.
The project continued using JavaScript as the primary development language.

==== Reasoning

* TypeScript offered significant advantages in terms of type safety, better tooling, and enhanced code quality.
* Tailwind CSS promised faster and more consistent frontend development.
* However, serious compatibility issues arose with the project's foundational base and its critical dependencies when integrating TypeScript. JavaScript, on the other hand, ensured full compatibility with existing dependencies and leveraged the team's strong prior experience.

==== Alternatives considered

* Continue using **JavaScript**:
  ** Pros:
     *** Full compatibility with existing project dependencies.
     *** Immediate development without additional configuration overhead.
     *** Team proficiency already high.
  ** Cons:
     *** Lack of static typing, increasing potential runtime errors.
     *** Slightly lower long-term maintainability compared to TypeScript.

==== Consequences

* Development continued smoothly without facing critical integration issues.
* Future migration to TypeScript remains a possibility, but would require significant planning and dependency refactoring.
* Styling strategies were adjusted, favoring traditional CSS Modules instead of Tailwind CSS for frontend components.




[[ADR-004]]
=== ADR 004: Wikidata SPARQL Integration
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 16/03/2025* 

==== Context

The application requires retrieving rich, structured information from Wikidata to answer user questions and enrich the user experience with semantic data.
Given the complexity of the data relationships and the dynamic nature of the content, a robust and standardized query mechanism was needed.

==== Decision

SPARQL was adopted as the primary method for querying Wikidata.

==== Reasoning

* SPARQL is the native query language for RDF datasets like Wikidata.
* It allows highly expressive queries involving relationships between entities, filters, and complex graph traversals.
* Wikidata provides a public SPARQL endpoint (Wikidata Query Service), eliminating the need to host or maintain a local copy of the dataset.
* Supports real-time access to the most up-to-date knowledge base.

==== Consequences

* Enables powerful and flexible data retrieval directly from Wikidata.
* Introduces a dependency on the availability and performance of the public SPARQL endpoint.
* Requires developers to learn and work with SPARQL syntax and semantic web concepts.
* May necessitate caching strategies or fallback plans to mitigate latency or downtime.




[[ADR-005]]
=== ADR 005: Oracle Cloud VM for Deployment Infrastructure
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 23/02/2025* 

==== Context

The application required a virtualized environment to deploy the frontend, backend services, the database, and monitoring tools. Initially, Microsoft Azure was considered as the deployment platform due to its popularity and having almost every member of the team some level of experince, thanks to having used it in other subjects.

However, during early planning, one team member already had access to an Oracle Cloud VM instance that was partially configured and available for use. This presented an opportunity to streamline deployment efforts and reduce setup time and cost.

==== Decision

The team decided to use an Oracle Cloud VM instance to host the project infrastructure.

==== Reasoning

* Immediate availability of an Oracle Cloud VM already partially configured.
* Team member already had experience managing this VM, including port configuration and service setup.
* Avoids incurring additional cloud infrastructure costs.
* Simplifies initial deployment and testing.
* With Oracle Cloud VM we can have the aplicattion deployed 24/7.
* In case anyone have to do any kind of work on the VM, giving access to it is simple because only SSH key and the IP are required.

==== Alternatives considered

*Azure Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)*

** Pros:
  *** Well-documented and widely adopted cloud platform.
  *** Integrated monitoring, CI/CD tools, and scalability features.
  *** Easier to integrate with enterprise authentication or other Azure-based services.
** Cons:
  *** Requires account setup, configuration, and billing.
  *** Team would need time to familiarize with the environment.
  *** No immediate advantage over the already available Oracle VM at this stage.
  *** In case we have used Azure, we would be obligated to turn on and off the application whenever it is necessary.

==== Consequences

* Faster initial deployment due to use of an already prepared environment.
* Reduced cloud infrastructure cost during the development.
* May require future migration or scaling strategy if the project grows or if Oracle Cloud VM limitations become restrictive.



[[ADR-006]]
=== ADR 006: Service-based System Architecture
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 23/02/2025* 

==== Context

In designing the backend system, the team considered different architectural styles to support modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
A pure microservices architecture was initially discussed and followed due to its popularity and the main project was built in a microservice based architecture.
However, during the development of the application, a service-based architecture was chosen instead.

==== Decision

The project adopts a service-based architecture, rather than a fully decoupled microservices model.

==== Reasoning

* Provides modularization and separation of concerns without the overhead of managing independent deployments for each service.
* Simplifies inter-service communication by avoiding complex patterns such as service discovery, load balancing, and distributed configuration.
* Better aligns with the existing project base and team size, facilitating easier maintenance and deployment.
* Reduces initial development and operational complexity.

==== Alternatives considered

*Pure Microservices Architecture*

** Pros:
  *** Strong decoupling, allowing for independent scaling and deployment of services.
** Cons:
  *** Overkill for small or medium-sized teams and projects with limited domain boundaries.

==== Consequences

* Enables a modular structure where services are separated logically but may coexist within the application itself.
* Facilitates faster development and easier testing given its monolithichal nature with less enviroment complexity.
* Allows future evolution toward microservices if project requirements grow.



[[ADR-007]]
=== ADR 007: Data Storage for Wikidata Information
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 16/03/2025* 

==== Context

Initially, the application fetched data from Wikidata in real time during gameplay to generate questions dynamically.
However, this approach caused severe performance issues, resulting in noticeable delays that degraded the user experience during matches.

==== Decision

To improve performance, the application now pre-generates and stores a set of questions in the database at the start of each game.
These stored questions are then served to the user dynamically throughout the match, minimizing latency.

==== Reasoning

* Real-time queries to Wikidata introduced unpredictable delays and negatively impacted gameplay flow.
* Preloading questions ensures smooth and uninterrupted user experience.
* Reduces dependency on external services during active sessions, making the game more stable and reliable.

==== Alternatives considered

*Inserting loading screens between questions*

** Pros:
  *** Would allow real-time querying to continue without significant architectural changes.
  *** Could be visually appealing with the right UI/UX design.
** Cons:
  *** Did not solve the root performance issue — only masked it.
  *** Introduced unwanted pauses that disrupted the game's pacing and fluidity.

==== Consequences

* Game sessions begin with a brief setup phase where questions are fetched and stored.
* Once the session starts, question delivery is fast and reliable, improving overall experience.
* The system is now more resilient to outages or slowdowns in the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint.



[[ADR-008]]
=== ADR 008: Styling Approach - CSS Modules
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 16/03/2025* 

==== Context

Maintaining scoped styles without introducing unnecessary complexity.

==== Decision

Use CSS Modules for styling, with partial hybridization where needed.

==== Reasoning

* Keeps styles encapsulated.
* Allows flexibility where global styles are needed.

==== Consequences

* Mixed styling approach may introduce slight overhead.


[[ADR-009]]
=== ADR 009: Choice and Strategy for Empathy LLM Models
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 07/04/2025* 

==== Context

To implement the chatbot system that provides hints during gameplay, the project required integration with a Large Language Model (LLM). The goal was to offer accurate, responsive, and trustworthy hints, as this directly affects the player's experience and engagement.

Initially, the team selected the **Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct** model from the Empathy LLM platform given he had access thanks to the API Key provided to us. However, as development progressed, it became apparent that system outages or instability in the LLM provider could render the chatbot feature temporarily unusable — severely impacting reliability.

==== Decision

We implemented a dual-model system using both **Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct** and **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3**, both available through Empathy LLM. The application now automatically switches between the two models depending on their availability, ensuring continued service during partial outages.

==== Reasoning

* Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct was initially chosen as it shown less tendency to cause hallucinations.
* However, Qwen showed higher sensitivity to downtime and occasional availability issues during use.
* Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, while slightly more verbose, provided reliable backup behavior and acceptable quality.
* The switch-over mechanism improves fault tolerance without significantly degrading response quality.

==== Alternatives considered

*Switch entirely to Mistral*

** Pros:
  *** More stable availability during testing.
** Cons:
  *** Lower quality in guided, instructional prompts; less aligned with user needs.
  *** Returning to a single-model setup would reintroduce the same availability risks — if Mistral fails, the chatbot would again become unusable.

==== Consequences

* Improved resilience and availability of the chatbot feature.
* Slight variability in hint style depending on the model currently active.
* Additional complexity added to the backend logic to monitor model health and manage fallback behavior.
* Future work could include evaluating additional models or services to further enhance reliability and output quality.





=== ADR 010: Monitoring Strategy  
*Status: Accepted*  📅  
*Date: 07/04/2025*  

=== Context

The application requires monitoring for:

* *Application metrics:* Performance (response times), errors, usage.
* *Infrastructure metrics:* VM resources (CPU, RAM, disk) on Oracle Cloud.

=== Decision

*Split monitoring approach*:

* Application: Prometheus (data collection) + Grafana (visualization).
* Infrastructure: Oracle Cloud Monitoring (pre-configured for VM).

==== Reasoning  
* **Prometheus/Grafana for Application**:  
** Already partially configured.  
** Customizable for app metrics (e.g., endpoint latency).  
** Open-source with integrations (e.g., Artillery).  
* **Oracle Cloud Monitoring for Infrastructure**:  
** Native to Oracle Cloud, minimal setup.  
** Already monitors other VM services.  
** Email alerts for thresholds (e.g., CPU > 90%).  
** Avoids duplicating metrics in Grafana (reduces overhead).  

==== Alternatives Considered  
* **Unified Monitoring in Grafana**:  
** Pros: Single dashboard.  
** Cons: Redundant with Oracle, increases VM load.  
* **Oracle Cloud Monitoring for All**:  
** Pros: Simplified vendor management.  
** Cons: Limited app metric customization.  

==== Consequences  
* **Pros**:  
** App metrics are portable and tailored.  
** Infra alerts reuse existing setup.  
** Clear separation (app vs. infra).  
* **Cons**:  
** Context-switching between dashboards.  
** Two toolchains to maintain.  


=== ADR 011: DNS and Reverse Proxy Setup
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 30/04/2025* 

==== Context

To allow users and services to access the deployed application on Oracle Cloud VM via a friendly domain and standard HTTP port, a DNS and reverse proxy solution was needed. The goal was to expose the service at a clean URL (`http://wic2c.duckdns.org`) instead of a raw IP address with a non-standard port.

==== Decision

The team chose to use **DuckDNS** as a free DNS provider and **Nginx** as a reverse proxy.

==== Reasoning

* **DuckDNS**:
  ** Free and simple dynamic DNS service.
  ** Allows mapping a custom subdomain (`wic2c.duckdns.org`) to the public IP address of the Oracle VM.
  ** No cost, no registration complexity.
* **Nginx**:
  ** Acts as a reverse proxy, listening on port `80`.
  ** Redirects traffic internally to port `3000`, where the application or monitoring stack is hosted.
  ** Enables clean, production-like access to services without exposing internal port numbers.

==== Alternatives considered

*Using only raw IP and ports*

** Pros:
  *** No need to configure DNS or proxy layers.
  *** Slightly faster setup.
** Cons:
  *** Users would need to remember IP addresses and ports (e.g., `http://123.45.67.89:3000`).
  *** Less professional appearance.
  *** Harder to manage and scale in future.

==== Consequences

* Users and developers can access the application at `http://wic2c.duckdns.org` using standard web protocols.
* Internal routing and ports remain abstracted, improving security and maintainability.
* Future enhancements (e.g., HTTPS, load balancing) can be layered onto the Nginx configuration.
* Reliance on DuckDNS introduces a small risk of service availability tied to a free third-party provider.

=== ADR 012: Load Testing Tool Selection
*Status: Accepted*
*:date: 02/05/2025*

==== Context

To ensure the application can handle expected traffic and identify performance bottlenecks, a load testing solution was needed. The tool should be flexible, scriptable, and provide clear metrics for analysis.

==== Reasoning

Open-source and designed for modern web applications.

Supports scripting complex user flows (e.g., login → actions → logout).

Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines.

Provides detailed reports (latency, RPS, error rates) and supports exporting metrics to Prometheus/Grafana.

Lightweight compared to alternatives like JMeter.

==== Alternatives Considered

*JMeter*
** Pros:
*** Mature tool with GUI for test design.
*** Extensive protocol support (HTTP, WebSockets, etc.).
** Cons:
*** Steeper learning curve.
*** Resource-heavy for large-scale tests.

*Locust*
** Pros:
*** Python-based, easy to extend.
*** Distributed testing support.
** Cons:
*** Requires more setup for advanced scenarios.

==== Consequences

Load testing can be automated as part of the deployment pipeline.

Performance baselines and regressions are tracked over time.

Requires maintaining test scripts alongside application changes.
