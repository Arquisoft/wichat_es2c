.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

[options="header"]
|===
| Prority | Quality Requirement | Scenario | Expected Outcome

| 1
| Usability
| A user enters the game and wants to play.
| They should have no issues logging in and understanding the game rules.

| 4
| Performance
| A large number of people join the game.
| This should not impact waiting times.

| 2
| Accuracy
| A player asks the chatbot for hints.
| The chatbot should not give the answer but also should not provide false hints.

| 3
| Scalability
| A new feature is added to the game.
| Other features should not be affected.

| 5
| Security
| A user registers with a password.
| The password must be securely encrypted and stored in the database.

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.
