== Risks and Technical Debts

.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technical Risks

When identifying and listing the project's *Technical Risks*, it is helpful to separate them into *Internal Risks* (arising within the system development process) and *External Risks* (coming from factors outside the direct control of the development team).

Prioritized from highest to lowest, they are as follows:

==== Internal Risks

[cols="3,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Internal Risk | Description | How to Deal With It
| *Lack of a Clear Work Plan* | Since we are starting from scratch, we still have many decisions and tasks ahead, making it difficult to clearly determine how each of us should proceed with the project. | As we progress and become familiar with the framework, we should collaboratively outline a work plan.
| *Adaptation to New Technologies* | The technologies we have chosen to work with are new to several team members, which may cause discomfort and future issues. | Watch instructional videos to learn how to use them and understand their main functionalities.
| *Limited Experience Working in Large Teams* | Since we lack experience working in large teams, the communication process may be somewhat confusing. | Follow teamwork best practices and guidelines, and use tools like Pull Requests to ensure better version control.
| *Project Deadlines Overlapping with Other Tasks* | Since all members are students, the various project deadlines may clash with other important dates, such as exams and assignments. | Keep up with the work, and if any such issues arise, inform the rest of the team so they are aware of the situation.
| *Team Members with Limited Experience in GitHub and Pull Requests* | Not all team members are proficient with *Pull Requests*, which significantly limits their initial contributions. | Learn and practice using this functionality.
| *Team members leaving* | A certain team member left after not putting in any work for a few weeks, leaving all of us with extra work. | Reorganizing our work and spending more time on this project.

==== External Risks

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| External Risk | Description
| *Dependence on API Functionality* | Since some application functionalities depend on external APIs, their proper operation is crucial for the app.
| *Server Uptime Dependency* | The application is hosted and deployed on a server, making its uptime essential.
| *New AI Technology* | This is a recent technology, and working with it presents a novelty, with less available information compared to other technologies.
| *GitHub and Cloudflare Issues* | Due to recent cases of some companies blocking *Cloudflare* from their servers, this could negatively impact the project, as it affects GitHub.

=== Technical Debts

At this stage, since we have only recently started working on this project, we have not yet accumulated *technical debt*. However, given our initial situation, we can anticipate the following:

[cols="3,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Debt | Description | How to Deal With It
| *Limited Familiarity with the Base Project* | We have been given a template to work from, but we are not yet fully familiar with its contents, even though this would be highly beneficial. | During the application design process, the team should review what parts of the application were provided and what is missing.
| *Technology Choices That Not All Members Are Experienced With* | We have chosen to work with certain programming languages in which we still lack experience, aiming to create the best possible application in the long run. | Try to become familiar with these technologies as soon as possible to avoid creating more problems in the future.
| *The team member that left left us a very broken timer component* | We decided to just make a new one from scratch.
