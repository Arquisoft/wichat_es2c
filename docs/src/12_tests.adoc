== Testing and Monitoring

We implemented a comprehensive testing and monitoring strategy to ensure the stability and
reliability of our project. A wide range of automated tests including unit,
and end-to-end tests were developed to validate the
functionality of each component and to detect potential issues early.
These tests help safeguard the system against regressions when introducing
new features or changes. Additionally, we established continuous
monitoring processes to track system performance and availability in real time,
allowing us to quickly identify and respond to any anomalies.
This proactive approach ensures that our project remains robust, scalable,
and consistently operational.

== Types of Tests Implemented

To guarantee code quality and system reliability, we implemented several types of tests aimed at different layers of the application.
Unit tests were developed using Jest, allowing us to validate individual components and functions in isolation.
These tests contribute significantly to our code coverage, which we continuously track using SonarQube to maintain high standards and detect untested or vulnerable areas.

In addition to unit testing, we created end-to-end (E2E) tests to simulate
real user interactions and verify that the application behaves correctly from the user’s perspective (for example, playing a game and then checking our stats).
These tests help ensure that critical user flows remain functional across updates.

To assess performance and scalability, we also conducted load testing,
which allowed us to evaluate how the system handles high volumes of traffic and to identify potential bottlenecks under stress.

Finally, we also used monitoring tools from oracle to help us detect any outrages in real time.

By combining these different types of testing, we’ve built a strong quality assurance framework that minimizes risk and ensures long-term maintainability.
